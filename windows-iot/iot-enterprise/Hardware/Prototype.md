# Start Prototyping

This guide walks you through how to start prototyping with Windows IoT Enterprise.

## Step 1: Select Hardware

To begin your prototyping journey, you can use your existing hardware that meets the Windows IoT Enterprise [hardware requirements](./Hardware_Requirements.md) or select one of the [recommended hardware platforms and boards](./Platforms_and_Boards.md). 

## Step 2: Evaluate Edition

To select which edition of Windows IoT Enterprise you would like to work with, review the [Windows IoT Enterprise Release History](../Features.md).

[!INCLUDE [Latest LTSC](../../includes/incl-latest-ltsc-release.md)]

## Step 3: Deploy an Image

If your hardware comes with instructions on how to deploy Windows IoT Enterprise, follow those instructions. Otherwise, you can follow the labs provided in the [Windows IoT Enterprise Manufacturing Guide](../Commercialization/Manufacturing-Guide.md).

## Step 4: Load an Application

You can choose to port over any of your existing [Windows applications](/windows/apps/desktop/choose-your-platform) or feel free to reference any of our [UWP app samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples) in GitHub.

## Step 5: Licensing & Distribution

If you're interested in pursuing your prototype, past the 90-day evaluation period, reach out to a Windows IoT distributor. Microsoft offers several Windows IoT products. Authorized distributors of Windows IoT products can help you choose the right product for your solution and help you build secure and connected Windows IoT solutions. If you would like to work with one of our distributors, please [select a distributor](https://aka.ms/IoTDistributorList) in your region and contact the distributor directly for more details.
