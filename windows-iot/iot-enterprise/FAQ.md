*If you require more assistance, [Contact Us](./Contact-Us.md).*

## What Windows for IoT Products are available today?

There are presently three Windows for IoT operating systems available:

1. [Windows IoT Enterprise](/windows/iot/iot-enterprise/overview)
1. [Windows 10 IoT Core](/windows/iot-core/windows-iot-core)
1. [Windows Server IoT 2022](/windows/iot/server/windows-server).

## What's the difference between Windows 10 IoT Enterprise and Windows 11 IoT Enterprise?

Windows 11 IoT Enterprise is the next evolution of Windows for IoT, and is built on the same foundation as Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. For more information, see [Windows IoT Enterprise Overview](Overview.md).

## What is the difference between Windows IoT Enterprise and Windows 10 IoT Core?

Windows IoT Enterprise is binary-equivalent to standard Windows Enterprise. We have incorporated all IoT features into both versions, but the IoT edition includes a few minor configuration differences at activation and has dramatically different pricing and licensing terms. Windows 10 IoT Core is the smallest version of the Windows 10 editions that uses the Windows 10 common core architecture. These editions enable building low-cost devices with fewer resources. Development for Windows 10 IoT Core uses the Universal Windows Platform.

See [Windows IoT Overview](/windows/iot/product-family/windows-iot) for more information.

## How do I know if I'm running Windows 10 IoT Enterprise?

Prior to version 1903, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise was sold as Windows 10 Enterprise with special keys.
However, version 1903 and onward, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is sold as a separate edition.

Windows 10 IoT Enterprise Version 1903 and beyond, you are able to confirm you're running Windows 10 IoT Enterprise under System Information.
