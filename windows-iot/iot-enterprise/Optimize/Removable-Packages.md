# Removable Packages

Applies to:  
âœ… Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021 (19044.1741 or later)  

## Overview

While all Windows editions can reduce on-disk footprint by removal of unnecessary [Features on Demand](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities) and [Legacy Optional Components](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/enable-or-disable-windows-features-using-dism), Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC provides support for the removal of even more feature packages.

Using the desktop manufacturing process to [Modify a Windows image](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/modify-an-image), a device maker can use either [Online servicing](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/audit-mode-overview) or [Offline Servicing](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/mount-and-modify-a-windows-image-using-dism) methods to completely remove packages in the following table from the [Windows Component Store](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/manage-the-component-store). Once packages are removed from the Windows Component Store, they can't be added back to the operating system. Restoring removed packages requires a reinstallation of the operating system.
