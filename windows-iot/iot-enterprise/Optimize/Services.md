# Guidance on disabling system services on Windows IoT Enterprise

**Applies to:**

Applies to:  
✅ Windows 11 IoT Enterprise  
✅ Windows 10 IoT Enterprise  
✅ Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021  

The Windows IoT Enterprise operating system includes many system services run in the background without a user interface to provide core operating system features.  Each service is configured to start under certain circumstances, which were carefully chosen for each service to provide a balance of performance, functionality and security for the typical Windows user.  These start types include the following.

- Automatically start when Windows starts
- Automatically start when a user logs in
- Manually start when the functionality that it provides is needed
- Disabled by default

When building a fixed-function, specialized device based on Windows IoT Enterprise a device maker might need to reconfigure these startup values to increase the security posture or reduce resource overhead by disabling services that aren't needed for a specific device scenario.  This article includes detailed guidance regarding which services can safely be disabled as well as links to [more resources](#more-resources) that provide step by step configuration instructions for multiple methods.

## Guidance descriptions

For all system services listed in this document, Microsoft provides guidance for enabling and disabling system services in Windows IoT Enterprise.

- **🟡 No guidance:** The effect of disabling these services isn't fully evaluated. Therefore, the default configuration of these services shouldn't be changed.
- **⛔ Don't disable:** Disabling this service impacts essential functionality by preventing specific roles and features from functioning correctly. Therefore it shouldn't be disabled.
- **🟢 OK to disable:** This service provides functionality that is useful to some but not all enterprises, and security-focused enterprises that don't use it can safely disable it.
- **✅&nbsp;Already&nbsp;disabled:** This service is disabled by default; no need to enforce with policy.
- **🔵&nbsp;Should&nbsp;be&nbsp;disabled:** This service should never be enabled on a well-managed enterprise system.

## Per User Services

When a user signs in to Windows, the OS creates per-user services. When the user signs out, these services are stopped and deleted. They run in the security context of the user account instead of a built-in security principal. Windows creates these per-user services based on templates defined in the registry. If you need to manage or control behaviors of these services, you can adjust the template. For more information about inspecting and configuring Per-user Services, see [Per User Services in Windows](/windows/application-management/per-user-services-in-windows)

The following table lists per-user services in the current version of Windows. Other versions of Windows 10/11 might not have the same services available. Before you reconfigure any of these services, review this information to understand the implications. For example, if you disable the per-user service, there might be dependent apps that don't work correctly.
