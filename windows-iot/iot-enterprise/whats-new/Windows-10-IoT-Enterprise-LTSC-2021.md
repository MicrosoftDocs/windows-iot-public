When log files are being searched, SetupDiag uses a set of rules to match known issues. In the current version of SetupDiag there are 53 rules contained in the rules.xml file, which is extracted when SetupDiag is run. The rules.xml file will be updated as new versions of SetupDiag are made available. For more information, see [SetupDiag](/windows/deployment/upgrade/setupdiag).|
| **Reserved Storage** | Reserved storage sets aside disk space to be used by updates, apps, temporary files, and system caches.

### Security

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Windows&nbsp;Defender System&nbsp;Guard** | Windows Defender System Guard Secure Launch protects bootup with a technology known as the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM). With DRTM, the system initially follows the normal UEFI Secure Boot process. However, before launching, the system enters a hardware-controlled trusted state that forces the CPU(s) down a hardware-secured code path. If a malware rootkit/bootkit has bypassed UEFI Secure Boot and resides in memory, DRTM will prevent it from accessing secrets and critical code protected by the virtualization-based security environment. Firmware Attack Surface Reduction technology can be used instead of DRTM on supporting devices such as Microsoft Surface. For more information, see [How a hardware-based root of trust helps protect Windows](/windows/security/hardware-security/how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows). |
| **Windows&nbsp;Defender Security&nbsp;Center** | Improvements now include Protection history, including detailed and easier to understand information about threats and available actions, Controlled Folder Access blocks are now in the Protection history, Windows Defender Offline Scanning tool actions, and any pending recommendations.

| **Windows&nbsp;Defender Firewall** | Windows Defender Firewall reduces the attack surface, helps enforce integrity and confidentiality of data, complements non-Microsoft network security solutions.  In this release, Windows Defender Firewall is also easier to analyze and debug using an in-box cross-component network diagnostic tool for Windows.  Additionally, event logs have been enhanced to ensure an audit can identify the specific filter that was responsible for any given event. For more information, see [Windows Defender Firewall](/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/) |
| **Microsoft&nbsp;Defender for&nbsp;Endpoint** |Enhancements including [attack surface area reduction](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-atp/overview-attack-surface-reduction), [tamper-proofing](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection), and [next generation protection](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10) against ransomware, credential misuse, and attacks transmitted through removable storage. Additional improvements in the areas of advanced machine learning, emergency outbreak protection, certified ISO 27001 compliance, geolocation support and non-ASCII file paths. </br> *Note: The [DisableAntiSpyware](/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/security-malware-windows-defender-disableantispyware) parameter is deprecated in this release.* |
| **Microsoft&nbsp;Defender Application&nbsp;Guard** | Performance improvements associated with memory utilization, copying files as well as opening a file using a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path or Server Message Block (SMB) share. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender Application Guard](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/wd-app-guard-overview) |
| **Windows&nbsp;Defender Application&nbsp;Control** |  Suport for [multiple simultaneous code integrity policies](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/deploy-multiple-windows-defender-application-control-policies) for one device, [path-based policy and file rules](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/create-path-based-rules), and [COM Object Registration](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/allow-com-object-registration-in-windows-defender-application-control-policy). |
