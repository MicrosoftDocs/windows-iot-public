## What's new

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Windows Assessment and Deployment Toolkit (ADK) | There's no new ADK for Windows 10, version 21H1. The ADK for Windows 10, version 2004 will also work with Windows 10, version 21H1.  For more information, see [Download and install the Windows ADK](/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install). |
| Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Group Policy Service (GPSVC) | An issue is fixed that caused changes by an Active Directory (AD) administrator to user or computer group memberships to propagate slowly. Although the access token eventually updates, these changes might not appear when the administrator uses gpresult /r or gpresult /h to create a report. |
| Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) | Performance improvements: </br> 1) Reduce the time to open a Microsoft Defender Application (WDAG) Office document using a UNC or SMB share link. </br> 2) Fix memory issue that could cause a WDAG container to use almost 1 GB of working set memory when the container is idle.  </br> 3) The performance of Robocopy is improved when copying files over 400 MB in size.
