### Security and scanning

The security and privacy features in Windows 11 are similar to Windows 10. Security for your devices starts with the hardware, and includes OS security, application security, and user & identity security. There are features available in the Windows OS to help in these areas. This section describes some of these features. For a more comprehensive view, including zero trust, see [Windows security](/windows/security/).

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows Security app** | Windows Security app is built into the OS. This app is an easy-to-use interface, and combines commonly used security features. For example, your get access to virus & threat protection, firewall & network protection, account protection, and more. </br></br> For more information, see [the Windows Security app](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-security-center/windows-defender-security-center). |
|**Security baselines** | Security baselines includes security settings that already configured, and ready to be deployed to your devices. If you don't know where to start, or it's too time consuming to go through all the settings, then you should look at Security Baselines.  </br></br> For more information, see [Windows security baselines](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-security-configuration-framework/windows-security-baselines). |
|**Microsoft Defender Antivirus** | Microsoft Defender Antivirus is built into Windows, and helps protect devices using next-generation security. When used with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, your organization gets strong endpoint protection, and advanced endpoint protection & response. If you use Intune to manage devices, then you can create policies based on threat levels in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.  </br></br> For more information, see: </br> - [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows)  </br> - [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint) </br> - [Enforce compliance for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/mem/intune/protect/advanced-threat-protection) |
| **Application Security** | The Application Security features help prevent unwanted or malicious code from running, isolate untrusted websites & untrusted Office files, protect against phishing or malware websites, and more. </br></br> For more information, see  [Windows application security](/windows/security/apps). |

### Use your same apps, and new apps, improved

| Feature | Description |
| --- | ---|
| **App Compatibility** | Your Windows 10 apps will also work on Windows 11. **[App Assure](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365/app-assure)** is also available if there are some issues. </br></br>   You can continue to use **MSIX packages** for your UWP, Win32, WPF, and WinForm desktop application files. Continue to use **Windows Package Manager** to install Windows apps. You can create **Azure virtual desktops** that run Windows 11. Use **Azure Virtual desktop with MSIX app attach** to virtualize desktops and apps. </br></br> For more information on these features, see [Overview of apps on Windows devices](/windows/application-management/apps-in-windows-10). Using an MDM provider, like Intune, you can create policies that also manage some app settings. For a list of settings, see [App Store in Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/device-restrictions-windows-10#app-store). </br></br> Your apps compiled for x64 processors will now work on ARM64 processors via emulation. For more information, see [ARM64EC](/windows/arm/arm64ec).
| **Windows Terminal app** | This app is included with the OS. On previous Windows versions, it's a separate download in the Microsoft Store. For more information, see [What is Windows Terminal?](/windows/terminal/). </br></br> This app combines Windows PowerShell, a command prompt, and Azure Cloud Shell all within the same terminal window. You don't need to open separate apps to use these command-line applications. It has tabs. And when you open a new tab, you can choose your command-line application.
|**Microsoft Edge** | The Microsoft Edge browser is included with the OS, and is the default browser. Internet Explorer (IE) isn't available in Windows 11. In Microsoft Edge, you can use IE Mode if a website needs Internet Explorer. Open Microsoft Edge, and enter `edge://settings/defaultBrowser` in the URL. </br></br> To save system resources, Microsoft Edge uses sleeping tabs. Users can configure these settings, and more, in `edge://settings/system`. </br></br> Using Group Policy or an MDM provider, such as Intune, you can configure some Microsoft Edge settings. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge - Policies](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies) and [Configure Microsoft Edge policy settings](/mem/intune/configuration/administrative-templates-configure-edge).

### Deployment and servicing

| Feature | Description |
| --- | ---|
| **Installation** | The same methods you use to install Windows 10 Iot Enterprise can also be used to install Windows 11 IoT Enterprise. For example, you can deploy Windows to your devices using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT), Configuration Manager, and more. Windows 11 IoT Enterprise will be delivered as an upgrade to eligible devices running Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. </br></br>   For more information on getting started, see [Windows client deployment resources and documentation](/windows/deployment/) and [Plan for Windows 11](/windows/whats-new/windows-11-plan). </br></br>  For more information on the end-user experience, see [Ways to install Windows 11](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/e0edbbfb-cfc5-4011-868b-2ce77ac7c70e). |
| **Microsoft Intune** | Microsoft Intune is a mobile application management (MAM) and mobile device management (MDM) provider. It helps manage devices, and manage apps on devices in your organization. You configure policies, and then deploy these policies to users and groups. You can create and deploy policies that install apps, configure device features, enforce PIN requirements, block compromised devices, and more. </br></br>  If you use Group Policy to manage your Windows 10 devices, then you can also use Group Policy to manage Windows 11 devices. In Intune, there are [administrative templates](/mem/intune/configuration/administrative-templates-windows) and the [settings catalog](/mem/intune/configuration/settings-catalog) that include many of the same policies. [Group Policy analytics](/mem/intune/configuration/group-policy-analytics) analyze your on-premises group policy objects. |
| **Windows Updates and Delivery optimization** | Windows Updates and Delivery optimization helps manage updates, and manage features on your devices. Starting with Windows 11, the OS feature updates are installed annually. For more information on servicing channels, and what they are, see [Servicing channels](/windows/deployment/update/waas-overview#servicing-channels). </br></br> Like Windows 10, Windows 11 will receive monthly quality updates. </br></br> You have options to install updates on your Windows devices, including Intune, Group Policy, Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), and more. For more information, see [Assign devices to servicing channels](/windows/deployment/update/waas-servicing-channels-windows-10-updates). </br></br> Some updates are large, and use bandwidth. Delivery optimization helps reduce bandwidth consumption. It shares the work of downloading the update packages with multiple devices in your deployment. Windows 11 updates are smaller, as they only pull down source files that are different. You can create policies that configure delivery optimization settings. For example, set the maximum upload and download bandwidth, set caching sizes, and more.  </br></br>   For more information, see [Delivery Optimization for Windows updates](/windows/deployment/update/waas-delivery-optimization).  </br></br> For more information on the end-user experience, see:  </br> - [Installation & updates](https://support.microsoft.com/office/installation-updates-2f9c1819-310d-48a7-ac12-25191269903c#PickTab=Windows_11) </br> - [Manage updates in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-updates-in-windows-643e9ea7-3cf6-7da6-a25c-95d4f7f099fe)
