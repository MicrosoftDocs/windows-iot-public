## Security Resources

| Topics | Description |
|--------|------------|
| [Introduction to Windows Security](/windows/security/introduction) | Organizations worldwide are adopting a Zero Trust security model based on the premise that no person or device anywhere can have access until safety and integrity is proven. Windows 11 is built on Zero Trust principles to enable hybrid productivity and new experiences anywhere, without compromising security. Windows 11 raises the security baselines with new requirements for advanced hardware and software protection that extends from chip to cloud. |
| [Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc?rtc=1) | The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) is part of the defender community and on the front line of security response evolution. For over 20 years MSRC has been working to improve security for our customers, learning from both successes and failures. Time has only reasserted MSRC's commitment to better protect customers and the broader ecosystem. |
| [Security Update Guide](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/) | MSRC investigates reports of security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products and services. This information is published in the Security Update Guide as part of the ongoing effort to help you manage security risks and keep your systems protected. |
| [Security Foundations](/windows/security/security-foundations/) | Microsoft is committed to continuously invest in improving our software development process, building highly secure-by-design software, and addressing security compliance requirements. At Microsoft, we embed security and privacy considerations from the earliest life-cycle phases of all our software development processes. We build in security from the ground for powerful defense in today's threat environment. |
| [Hardware Security](/windows/security/hardware-security/) | Learn about hardware security features support in Windows, including Hardware root-of trust, Silicon assisted security and Secured-core PC. |
| [Operating System Security](/windows/security/operating-system-security/) | Security features in Windows include system security, virus and threat protection, network security, encryption and data protection. |
| [Application Security](/windows/security/application-security/) | Cybercriminals can take advantage of poorly secured applications to access valuable resources. With Windows, IT admins can combat common application attacks from the moment a device is provisioned. For example, IT can remove local admin rights from user accounts, so that PCs run with least privilege to prevent malicious applications from accessing sensitive resources. |
| [Identity Protection](/windows/security/identity-protection/) | Learn about identity protection technologies in Windows, including passwordless sign-in, and advanced credential protection.  |
| [Windows and Cloud Security](/windows/security/cloud-security/) | Windows works with Microsoft cloud services to safeguard sensitive information while controlling access and mitigating threats. |
