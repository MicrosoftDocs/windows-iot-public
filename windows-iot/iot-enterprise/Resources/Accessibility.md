# Windows IoT Enterprise Accessibility

## Accessibility Resources

Microsoft is dedicated to making its products and services accessible and usable for everyone. Windows includes accessibility features that benefit all users. These features make it easier to customize the computer and give users with different abilities options to improve their experience with Windows.

This article helps you as the IT administrator learn about built-in accessibility features. It also includes recommendations for how to support people in your organization who use these features.

Windows 11, version 22H2, includes improvements for people with disabilities: system-wide live captions, Focus sessions, voice access, and more natural voices for Narrator. For more information, see [New accessibility features coming to Windows 11](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2022/05/10/new-accessibility-features-coming-to-windows-11/) and [How inclusion drives innovation in Windows 11](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=177554).<!-- 6294246 -->

## General Recommendations

- **Be aware of Ease of Access settings**. Understand how people in your organization might use these settings. Help people in your organization learn how they can customize Windows.

- **Don't block settings**. Avoid using group policy or MDM settings that override Ease of Access settings.

- **Encourage choice**. Allow people in your organization to customize their computers based on their needs. That customization might be installing an add-on for their browser, or a non-Microsoft assistive technology.
