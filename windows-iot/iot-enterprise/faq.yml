    - question: What is Windows IoT Enterprise?
      answer: |
            Windows IoT Enterprise is a full version of Windows Enterprise designed for IoT devices. It provides the same enterprise manageability and security features as Windows Enterprise, but is tailored for fixed-purpose devices such as ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, industrial automation systems, medical devices, digital signage, and more. 

            [Top of General Section](faq.yml#General)

    - question: Can I upgrade my Windows IoT Enterprise to a newer version?
      answer: |
            Devices running a previous version of Windows IoT Enterprise (non-LTSC) can be upgraded through regular update channels such as Windows Update, Windows Server Update Services (including Configuration Manager), Windows Update for Business, and the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC).
  
            Upgrading to a newer version of Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC requires a new license.
  
            Before upgrading, check that your device meets the [system requirements](Hardware/System_Requirements.md) for the version of Windows IoT Enterprise you're upgrading to.

    - question: What are the pros and cons of LTSC compared to other editions of Windows?
      answer: |
          Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC is ideal for fixed-purpose devices that don't require or can't accept frequent feature updates. In addition, each Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC release is supported for 10 years (5 years of mainstream support and 5 years of extended support). Finally, Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC has [lower minimum system requirements](./Hardware/System_Requirements.md) compared to other editions of Windows.

          The Windows IoT Enterprise General Availability Channel (GAC) editions are ideal for fixed purpose devices that can be updated more frequently to get new feature and improvements.

          Windows Enterprise, Pro, and Home editions are designed for general-purpose computing devices and aren't recommended for fixed-purpose devices.
