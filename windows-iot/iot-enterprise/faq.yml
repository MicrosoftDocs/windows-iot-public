    - question: How do I know if I'm running Windows IoT Enterprise?
      answer: |
            There are a number of ways to identify if you're running Windows IoT Enterprise through the Settings app or at the command line in PowerShell. The following table summarizes the different ways.

            | Method | Steps | Windows IoT Enterprise | Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC |
            | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
            | Settings App | 1. Open the Settings app </br> 2. Navigate to System -> About </br> 3. Look for the Edition field | Edition says Windows 10 IoT Enterprise or Windows 11 IoT Enterprise | Edition says Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC or Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC |  
            | Dism | 1. Open a command prompt or a PowerShell window with Administrator privileges </br> 2. Type in the command `dism /online /get-currentedition` | CurrentEdition says "IoTEnterprise" | CurrentEdition says "IoTEnterpriseS" |
            | PowerShell Get-WindowsEdition command | 1. Open a PowerShell window with Administrator privileges </br> 2. Type in the command `Get-WindowsEdition -Online` | Edition says "IoTEnterprise" | Edition says "IoTEnterpriseS" |
            | WMI | 1. Open a PowerShell window </br> 2. Type in the command `(Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).OperatingSystemSKU` | 188 | 191 (or 207 if using the Evaluation Edition) |

            > [!NOTE]
            > Prior to version 1903, Windows IoT Enterprise OS was sold as Windows Enterprise with special keys. For these versions, the methods listed would show the values for Windows Enterprise.

    - question: What editions of Windows IoT Enterprise are available?
      answer: |
            There are two main editions: Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC and Windows IoT Enterprise.

            Windows IoT Enterprise Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) is supported for 10 years and is ideal for fixed-purpose devices that don't require or can't accept frequent feature updates.

            The non-LTSC edition of Windows IoT Enterprise follows the modern-lifecycle policy and is ideal for fixed-function devices that can be updated frequently to get new features and improvements.

    - question: When is the next Windows IoT Enterprise release?
      answer: |
          Windows IoT Enterprise GAC is typically released annually. Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC is typically released every three years. For the latest information on Windows IoT Enterprise releases, see [Release History](./whats-new/Release-History.md).

            [Top of FAQ](faq.yml)

    - question: Can I upgrade my Windows IoT Enterprise to a newer version?
      answer: |
            Upgrading Windows IoT Enterprise refers to moving to a new major version (e.g. version 21H2 -> version 22H2, or version LTSC 2021 -> version LTSC 2024).

            Devices running a previous version of Windows IoT Enterprise (non-LTSC) can be upgraded by applying a feature update that is delivered through regular update channels such as Windows Update, Windows Server Update Services (including Configuration Manager), Windows Update for Business, and the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC).
  
            Upgrading to a newer version of Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC requires a new OS and a new license, and can only be performed by or with the assistance of the device OEM. 
  
            Before upgrading to a newer version of Windows IoT Enterprise, check that your device meets the [system requirements](Hardware/System_Requirements.md) for that version.

          In addition, Windows IoT Enterprise shares the same commitment to security as Windows, providing customers peace of mind against threat actors.

          Customers also love the Windows IoT Enterprise Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) edition, which provides an industry-leading 10 years of security updates.

          [Top of FAQ](faq.yml)

    - question: What is Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)?
      answer: |
          Long-Term Servicing Channel refers to the version of Windows IoT Enterprise that is released approximately every three years and is supported for 10 years after release (5 years of mainstream support and 5 years of extended support). Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC is ideal for fixed-purpose devices that need to prioritize preservation of the original state of the OS over receiving frequent feature updates.

          [Top of FAQ](faq.yml)

    - question: How long is Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC supported?
      answer: |
          Each release of Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC is supported for 10 years (5 years of mainstream support and 5 years of extended support) starting from its release date. For support end dates specific to each LTSC release, see the [Windows IoT Enterprise Release History page](./whats-new/Release-History.md).

          [Top of FAQ](faq.yml)

    - question: Can I upgrade from one LTSC to the next LTSC?
      answer: |
          Yes. 
          
          From a licensing perspective, upgrading from one LTSC to a newer LTSC involves getting a new license. First, check with your device maker to determine what upgrade options are offered for the device. End-customers with an existing Microsoft Volume License agreement may also have the option to upgrade Windows IoT Enterprise devices via Volume Licensing. Learn more about these two paths in the [Licensing Guide](./Commercialization/Licensing.md).
          
          From a technical perspective, upgrading from one LTSC to a newer LTSC can either be an in-place upgrade or a reinstall. Due to the specialized nature of Windows IoT devices, check with your device maker first for guidance to ensure that an upgrade to the newer LTSC is supported on your device. In addition, ensure that your device meets the [system requirements](Hardware/System_Requirements.md) for the version of the LTSC you're upgrading to.

          [Top of FAQ](faq.yml)

    - question: What are the pros and cons of LTSC compared to other editions of Windows?
      answer: |
          Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC is ideal for fixed-purpose devices that need to prioritize preservation of the original state of the OS over receiving frequent feature updates. In addition, each Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC release is supported for 10 years via the [Fixed Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/fixed). Finally, Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC has [lower minimum system requirements](./Hardware/System_Requirements.md) compared to other editions of Windows.

          The non-LTSC version of Windows IoT Enterprise is similar to the LTSC version, but follows the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern). It is ideal for fixed-purpose devices that can receive frequent feature updates.

          Windows Enterprise, Pro, and Home editions are designed for general-purpose computing devices and aren't recommended for fixed-purpose devices.
