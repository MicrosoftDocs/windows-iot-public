# Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC in Volume License

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021

> [!NOTE]
> As of August 1, 2023, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021 is now available for purchase through the following programs: _Select Plus_, _Microsoft Product and Services Agreement (MPSA)_, and _Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)_.  Currently, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021 is not available through the Enterprise Agreement program.  
> For more information, see [Windows Desktop Operating System Program Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/WindowsDesktopOperatingSystem/all).

## Introduction

Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC is now available through [Volume Licensing](/partner-center/support-resources-licensing) in addition to original equipment manufacturer preinstallation on a specialized device. Volume licensing is available to customers who purchase software under various volume programs (such as [Open](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/licensing-programs/open-license) and [Select](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/licensing-programs/select)).  Licenses for Windows IoT Enterprise provided through volume licensing cover upgrades only.

Volume activation provides two ways to complete volume activations. Customers may use either key types to activate systems in their organization:

- [Key Management Service (KMS)](/windows/deployment/volume-activation/activate-windows-10-clients-vamt#how-key-management-service-works) allows organizations to activate systems within their own network.
- [Multiple Activation Key (MAK)](/windows/deployment/volume-activation/activate-windows-10-clients-vamt#how-multiple-activation-key-works) activates systems on a one-time basis, using Microsoft hosted activation services.

For more information, see [Plan for Volume Activation](/windows/deployment/volume-activation/plan-for-volume-activation-client).

> [!NOTE]
> Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC is intended for use for fixed-function specialized devices only and cannot be used as a replacement of Windows desktop for general purpose computing.

## Prerequisites

To deploy Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021 with volume activation you need the following assets from your [Volume License Administrator](/licensing/administrator-faq), typically associated with the procurement process.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 (x64) installation media or ISO
> - Multiple Activation Key (MAK) if you are not using an on-prem Key Management Service (KMS)

## Getting Started

In this section, you install **Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021** then transform it into **Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021** using a 5-by-5 volume activation key associated with the activation model that best suits your needs.

1. **Install Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021**</br>
   Using the media for Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 acquired through your Volume License Service Center or Visual Studio Subscription

1. **Install Latest Cumulative Updates**</br>
   The activation keys for Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021 require the installation of 2023-05 Cumulative update (10.0.19044.2905) or a more recent successor.
   - Select **Start**
   - Select **Settings**
   - Select **Windows Update**
   - Select **Check for Updates**
   - Install all available updates

   Alternatively, you can install the update and its prerequisites manually using the 2023-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 21H2 or a more recent successor.  For more information about this update, see [KB5026361](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/may-9-2023-kb5026361-os-builds-19042-2965-19044-2965-and-19045-2965-3edafffe-c3cc-4010-af43-2097c84c9437).

1. **Start PowerShell with Administrator privileges.**</br>
   You use this instance of PowerShell to verify the target operating system meets requirements then perform the transformation.  
    - Select **Start**
    - Type PowerShell
    - Right-click **Windows PowerShell**
    - Select **Run as administrator**

1. **Verify the Windows version and edition**</br>
   Run the following command from the PowerShell prompt to retrieve the version and edition information.

   ```powershell
   Dism /Online /Get-CurrentEdition
   ```

   The following properties are required to continue to the next step:

   - `ImageVersion : 10.0.19044.2905` _or later_</br>
   - `Current Edition : EnterpriseS`

1. **Install a product key**</br>
   In this step you use the command line utility `slmgr.vbs /ipk` to install a product key associated with your desired activation model.

   1. **KMS Client**</br>
      Install the Generic Volume License Key (GVLK) for Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC if you plan to activate using an on-premises key management service.</br>
      GVLK: `KBN8V-HFGQ4-MGXVD-347P6-PDQGT`

      ```cmd
      slmgr /ipk KBN8V-HFGQ4-MGXVD-347P6-PDQGT
      ```

   1. **Multiple Activation Key (MAK)**</br>
      Install the Multiple Activation Key that you acquired through the Volume License Service Center.</br>

      ```cmd
      slmgr /ipk XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
      ```

      Where XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX is your Multiple Activation Key (MAK)

1. **Verify transformation**</br>
   Upon successfully installing the product key associated with your volume license activation model, the operating system edition changes to `IoTEnterpriseS`.  Run the following command at the PowerShell prompt to confirm.

   ```powershell
   Dism /Online /Get-CurrentEdition
   ```

   You should now see the same ImageVersion but the Current Edition has changed to `IoTEnterpriseS` as follows:

   - `ImageVersion : 10.0.19044.2905` _or later_</br>
   - `Current Edition : IoTEnterpriseS`

1. **Confirm activation expiry**
   Run the following command at the PowerShell command prompt to verify the expiry of your volume license activation.

   ```cmd
   slmgr /xpr
   ```

   If you're using MAK activation, a message indicating that the machine is permanently activated appears.

   If you're using KMS client activation, a message appears with a date that your current volume activation expires. Your device attempts to sync with the on-premises Key Management Service and renew its activation periodically.
