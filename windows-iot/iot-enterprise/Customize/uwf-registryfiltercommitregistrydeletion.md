# UWF_RegistryFilter.CommitRegistryDeletion

## Syntax

```powershell
UInt32 CommitRegistryDeletion(
    string Registrykey,
    string ValueName
);
```

## Parameters

**RegistryKey**</br>A string that contains the full path of the registry key that contains the value to be deleted. If *ValueName* is empty, the entire registry key is deleted.

**ValueName**</br>A string that contains the name of the value to be deleted.

## Return Value

Returns an HRESULT value that indicates [WMI status](/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-non-error-constants) or a [WMI error](/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-error-constants).
